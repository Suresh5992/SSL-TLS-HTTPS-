RAW SAME THING SSL/TLS -HTTPS ,HTTP


SSL /TLS/https  Certification 

ssl --> Secure Socket Layer it is old process to secure data over Internet --> it you want to convert Latest Version it called TLS (Transport Layer Security) 

TLS is the Latest , to secure the security 

SSL -- OLD 
TLS - NEW ONE mostly used 

why TLS is used now ??



HTTP(Hyper Text Transfer protocaol) -- when you login any portal ex: bank portal we give username , passwd  .... so http means destils can e Transfer 

user to bank , may hacker also hack it 

so , that is main reson HTTPS came to reslove the issue (from the user side and bank side date will be Encrypted both sides) 

bank login 
 we are tranforing the data to bank , we need to check 2 things 

1.Encrypted 
2. Authentic (bank portal or not ) 
3. intergrity ( no middle modification done )

this is main reason HTTPS is used 

*** most important HTTPS HOW S will come 

S comes from (TLS or SSL )

When you visit any website you can see HTTPS security (*** in that we can see public Key ) 

what is public keys??
if you have key --> we can Encrypted the data | if we have key we can Decryted the data 
note : it should be same key for Encrypted and Decryted  ---> this is called Symmetic Key Encryption 
single key [ Encrypted done and Decryted done ]  


***most important 

we saw website public key , but it is visible , then hacker also see the public Key 


****for that before Symmetic we will do  ASymmetic process for Encryption
ASymmetic --> two keys are involved --> 1.  public key 	
									    2. private key 
										
public key : ex: surya.k9010@gmail.com  --> any one can send mail 
private key : to read mail's passwd needed private key is passwd 

*** if you want to Encrypted any data we use  ASymmetic (public key ) to Decryted that data we needed ( private key ) this is called ASymmetic key 

summary :

if you use same key  :  Symmetic key Encryption

if you have public private key pair you have we cam use ASymmetic key Encryption for that .


now we will see in SSL and TLS how ASymmetic key Encryption how it works ??

Client : search Engine  | server : any website (trainwithshubam.com)

as a clinet from the search Engine we visit (hit) to trainwithshubam.com 


Client (broswer)											server 

1. TCP Handshake 
from the client we are hitting server with my Request  
1. From server to TCP send Acknowlgemnt ( here Request and Response done )

Note : TCP Handshake rule is : 3 WAYS Handshake 

1. from the TCP Handshake to server :  now we can Establish the connection 

----------------  3 WAYS Handshake is done from the TCP ---------------------------------

										2. Certification Check 
																				                    
Client                                                  	server

 2 . To check the Client(broswer)  Certification check send Request to server 
 ex: client send "HEELO" TO server 
 
 Now server has public key and private key both 
 
 server send public key as Response to Client  [  This ðŸ”‘ public key is ðŸ“œ Certificate key  ] 
 
 note : private key is passwd we can't send it .
 
 broswer keep public key (certifiaction key with it ) whixh is send my server 
 
 this will be happens when IT is HTTPS connection IS There it will work ( certifiaction ) 
 
 If HTTP means then --> it show connection is not Secure it will Displayed

						         	Key Exchane 

 
 Client                                                  	server


in the client side key  is created --> Seesion Key  

Session key will maintain (DATA can Transfer + No hacker can Invlove) 

***note :  1. this session key must have Client and Server sides both 
2. we have public key  in client side   by using public key session will create --> Encrypted data prepared  

3. this Encrypted data pass to Sever


from the server side 
1. server side has Private Key  by using private key --> which is send my client Encrypted data we will Decryted that (session key ) 

summary :  

client : session key encripted data by using public key 

server :   Decryted data by using private key  then we  see Session key 


*** Data Transfer with Symmetic Key Encryption

data will flow both Directions , in this way 3  WAYS Handshake Done Here . 



how to get ssl Certificate 


we have crested any website http --> go any domain provided serverices 

Let's Encrypt is opensource 

email address: public and private (pair Genarate) 

domain name : suresh.com
