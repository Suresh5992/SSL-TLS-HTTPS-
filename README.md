# SSL-TLS-HTTPS

**✅ Key Concepts**
| Protocol | Description                               |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **SSL**  | Secure Socket Layer (Old, Outdated)       |
| **TLS**  | Transport Layer Security (Modern, Secure) |


✅ Why TLS is Used Now?

HTTP is not secure.
Example: When logging into a bank portal, the username and password can be intercepted by hackers if using HTTP.
HTTPS (HTTP Secure) ensures:
Encryption: Data is unreadable to outsiders.
Authentication: Confirms communication with the correct server (bank website).
Integrity: Ensures data is not modified during transfer.

✅ HTTPS → How the ‘S’ Comes?
The ‘S’ in HTTPS is provided by SSL/TLS protocols.
When visiting HTTPS websites, browsers show Certificates containing Public Keys


**✅ Key Encryption Methods**
| Type                      | Description                                          |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Symmetric Encryption**  | Same key is used for encryption and decryption.      |
| **Asymmetric Encryption** | Uses Public Key (encrypt) and Private Key (decrypt). |

**🔑 Symmetric Encryption**
One key is used.
Same key used for both encryption and decryption.

**🔑 Asymmetric Encryption**
Two keys are used:
Public Key: Visible to everyone.
Private Key: Kept secret by the owner.
Example:
Public Email: surya.k9010@gmail.com (Anyone can send).
Password: Only you can read (private key).



**✅ SSL/TLS Handshake Process**

**Step 1: TCP 3-Way Handshake**

Establishes initial connection.
Client → Server: Request
Server → Client: Acknowledgment
Connection is Established.

**Step 2: Certificate Exchange**

Flow:

Client (Browser)                  Server (Website)
       |         Hello                |
       |----------------------------->|
       |                           Sends Public Key (Certificate)
       |<-----------------------------|
       | Stores Server's Certificate |

The browser sends a Hello message.
Server responds with its Public Key (Certificate).
Browser stores the public key to use for encryption.

**Step 3: Key Exchange (Session Key)**
Flow:
Client                                Server
       | Creates Session Key              |
       | Encrypts Session Key using       |
       | Server’s Public Key              |
       |--------------------------------->|
       |                              Uses Private Key to decrypt Session Key
       |<--------------------------------|


  . Client creates a Session Key.
  . Client encrypts the Session Key using the Server’s Public Key.
  .Server decrypts it using its Private Key.

  **Step 4: Data Exchange using Symmetric Encryption**

  Flow:

  Client <-----------------------> Server
      |       Secure Data Transfer       |
      |    (Using Symmetric Encryption)  |
      
From this point, data is exchanged securely using the Session Key (Symmetric Encryption).

**✅ Summary of SSL/TLS Handshake**

| Step | Process                                  |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1    | TCP 3-Way Handshake                      |
| 2    | Certificate (Public Key) Sharing         |
| 3    | Session Key Creation and Exchange        |
| 4    | Secure Data Transfer using Symmetric Key |

**✅ How to Get SSL Certificate?**

Purchase from Domain Providers.
Use Free SSL Certificate from Let’s Encrypt.
Required:
Email Address
Domain Name (Example: suresh.com)

**✅ Visual Diagram: SSL/TLS Handshake**

Step 1: TCP Handshake
Client -----------------> Server (Request)
Client <----------------- Server (Acknowledge)
Connection Established

Step 2: Certificate Exchange
Client -----------------> Server ("Hello")
Client <----------------- Server (Public Key/Certificate)

Step 3: Session Key Exchange
Client (Create Session Key)
Client -----------------> Server (Encrypted with Public Key)
Client <----------------- Server (Decrypted with Private Key)

Step 4: Secure Data Transfer
Client <===============> Server (Encrypted Data Transfer using Session Key)


**✅ Final Key Points**
HTTPS = HTTP + SSL/TLS
TLS is the upgraded, more secure version of SSL.
Asymmetric encryption is used for key exchange.
Symmetric encryption is used for data transfer.
SSL Certificates validate the website’s authenticity and enable encryption.
