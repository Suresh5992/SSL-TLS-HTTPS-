# SSL-TLS-HTTPS

**âœ… Key Concepts**
| Protocol | Description                               |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **SSL**  | Secure Socket Layer (Old, Outdated)       |
| **TLS**  | Transport Layer Security (Modern, Secure) |


âœ… Why TLS is Used Now?

HTTP is not secure.
Example: When logging into a bank portal, the username and password can be intercepted by hackers if using HTTP.
HTTPS (HTTP Secure) ensures:
Encryption: Data is unreadable to outsiders.
Authentication: Confirms communication with the correct server (bank website).
Integrity: Ensures data is not modified during transfer.

âœ… HTTPS â†’ How the â€˜Sâ€™ Comes?
The â€˜Sâ€™ in HTTPS is provided by SSL/TLS protocols.
When visiting HTTPS websites, browsers show Certificates containing Public Keys


**âœ… Key Encryption Methods**
| Type                      | Description                                          |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Symmetric Encryption**  | Same key is used for encryption and decryption.      |
| **Asymmetric Encryption** | Uses Public Key (encrypt) and Private Key (decrypt). |

**ðŸ”‘ Symmetric Encryption**
One key is used.
Same key used for both encryption and decryption.

**ðŸ”‘ Asymmetric Encryption**
Two keys are used:
Public Key: Visible to everyone.
Private Key: Kept secret by the owner.
Example:
Public Email: surya.k9010@gmail.com (Anyone can send).
Password: Only you can read (private key).



**âœ… SSL/TLS Handshake Process**

**Step 1: TCP 3-Way Handshake**

Establishes initial connection.
Client â†’ Server: Request
Server â†’ Client: Acknowledgment
Connection is Established.

**Step 2: Certificate Exchange**

Flow:

Client (Browser)                  Server (Website)
       |         Hello                |
       |----------------------------->|
       |                           Sends Public Key (Certificate)
       |<-----------------------------|
       | Stores Server's Certificate |

The browser sends a Hello message.
Server responds with its Public Key (Certificate).
Browser stores the public key to use for encryption.

**Step 3: Key Exchange (Session Key)**
Flow:
Client                                Server
       | Creates Session Key              |
       | Encrypts Session Key using       |
       | Serverâ€™s Public Key              |
       |--------------------------------->|
       |                              Uses Private Key to decrypt Session Key
       |<--------------------------------|


  . Client creates a Session Key.
  . Client encrypts the Session Key using the Serverâ€™s Public Key.
  .Server decrypts it using its Private Key.

  **Step 4: Data Exchange using Symmetric Encryption**

  Flow:

  Client <-----------------------> Server
      |       Secure Data Transfer       |
      |    (Using Symmetric Encryption)  |
      
From this point, data is exchanged securely using the Session Key (Symmetric Encryption).

**âœ… Summary of SSL/TLS Handshake**

| Step | Process                                  |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1    | TCP 3-Way Handshake                      |
| 2    | Certificate (Public Key) Sharing         |
| 3    | Session Key Creation and Exchange        |
| 4    | Secure Data Transfer using Symmetric Key |

**âœ… How to Get SSL Certificate?**

Purchase from Domain Providers.
Use Free SSL Certificate from Letâ€™s Encrypt.
Required:
Email Address
Domain Name (Example: suresh.com)

**âœ… Visual Diagram: SSL/TLS Handshake**

Step 1: TCP Handshake
Client -----------------> Server (Request)
Client <----------------- Server (Acknowledge)
Connection Established

Step 2: Certificate Exchange
Client -----------------> Server ("Hello")
Client <----------------- Server (Public Key/Certificate)

Step 3: Session Key Exchange
Client (Create Session Key)
Client -----------------> Server (Encrypted with Public Key)
Client <----------------- Server (Decrypted with Private Key)

Step 4: Secure Data Transfer
Client <===============> Server (Encrypted Data Transfer using Session Key)


**âœ… Final Key Points**
HTTPS = HTTP + SSL/TLS
TLS is the upgraded, more secure version of SSL.
Asymmetric encryption is used for key exchange.
Symmetric encryption is used for data transfer.
SSL Certificates validate the websiteâ€™s authenticity and enable encryption.
